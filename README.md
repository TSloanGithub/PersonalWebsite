This is a webpage that will be used as the portfolio/resume that I submit to potential employers post-bootcamp.
I will update this with basic information about myself, list my projects in my portfolio, and provide my LinkedIn.
The about page will contain information about myself that will include personal life information.
The portfolio page will highlight all of my projects as I move forward through my software engineering path.
